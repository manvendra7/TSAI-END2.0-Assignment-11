# TSAI-END2.0-Assignment-11

1. Follow the similar strategy as we did in our baby-steps-code (Links to an external site.), but replace GRU with LSTM. In your code you must:
    * Perform 1 full feed forward step for the encoder manually
    * Perform 1 full feed forward step for the decoder manually.
    * You can use any of the 3 attention mechanisms that we discussed. 

2. Explain your steps in the readme file and
3. Submit the assignment asking for these things:
    * Link to the readme file that must explain Encoder/Decoder Feed-forward manual steps and the attention mechanism that you have used - 500 pts
    * Copy-paste (don't redirect to github), the Encoder Feed Forward steps for 2 words - 250 pts
    * Copy-paste (don't redirect to github), the Decoder Feed Forward steps for 2 words - 250 pts
